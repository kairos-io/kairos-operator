              APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object.
              Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and

                description: |-
                  Concurrency specifies the maximum number of nodes that can run the upgrade operation simultaneously.
                  When set to 0 (default), the operation will run on all target nodes at the same time.
                  When set to a positive number, only that many jobs will run concurrently.
                  As jobs complete, new jobs will be started on remaining nodes until all target nodes are processed.

                  Force specifies whether to perform the upgrade without checking if the current version
                  matches the target version. When true, the upgrade will proceed regardless of version comparison.

                  Image is the container image to use for running the upgrade command.
                  This should contain the Kairos version and dependencies needed for upgrade.

              stopOnFailure:
                description: |-
                  StopOnFailure specifies whether to stop creating new jobs when a job fails.
                  When true, if any job fails, no new jobs will be created for remaining nodes.
                  This is useful for canary deployments where you want to stop on the first failure.

              targetNodes:
                description: |-
                  TargetNodes is a list of node names to run the upgrade operation on.
                  If empty, the operation will run on all nodes.

                  UpgradeActive specifies whether to upgrade the active partition.
                  When true, the active partition will be upgraded.
                  This is the default behavior for most upgrade scenarios.

              upgradeRecovery:

                  UpgradeRecovery specifies whether to upgrade the recovery partition.
                  When true, the recovery partition will be upgraded.
